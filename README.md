DJI Tello Drone Control With An Android App

Drone Programming With Python 2023
UNILAG DESIGN STUDIO

<b>APPRECIATION</b>
<p>My gratitude goes to Engr. Williams Baah, UNILAG DESIGN STUDIO, for putting together this opportunity to learn and apply what we were taught. This has laid a foundation, upon which i can practically build other programming and robotics concepts</p>

<b>Project Description</b>
<p>I, Adewole Benard, a 500-level student of the Department of Systems Engineering, University of Lagos, as a participant in the "Drone programming with Python" program developed a drone controlling app as a capstone project.</p>
<p>This report presents the design and development of a drone-controlling app that allows users to control their drones remotely through a mobile device. The app was developed with a user-friendly interface and is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms. The app's features include live video streaming, flight control, and telemetry data display. The project is called Skysteer</p>

<b>Design And Development</b>
<p>The application will be built with C# programming language, in the MAUI .NET platform. Using this technology, the app has the ability to be cross-platform. That is, it can run on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. But I will streamline this to just Android and iOS, seeing that these devices are as portable and handy as a game controller
The drone-controlling app was designed with simplicity and user experience in mind. The app's interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with large buttons for controlling the drone's movement</p>
