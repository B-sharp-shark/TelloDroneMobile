DJI Tello Drone Control With An Android App

Drone Programming With Python 2023
UNILAG DESIGN STUDIO

<b>APPRECIATION</b>
<p>My gratitude goes to Engr. Williams Baah, UNILAG DESIGN STUDIO, for putting together this opportunity to learn and apply what we were taught. This has laid a foundation, upon which i can practically build other programming and robotics concepts</p>

<b>Project Description</b>
<p>I, Adewole Benard, a 500-level student of the Department of Systems Engineering, University of Lagos, as a participant in the "Drone programming with Python" program developed a drone controlling app as a capstone project.</p>
<p>This report presents the design and development of a drone-controlling app that allows users to control their drones remotely through a mobile device. The app was developed with a user-friendly interface and is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms. The app's features include live video streaming, flight control, and telemetry data display. The project is called Skysteer</p>

<b>Design And Development</b>
<p>The application will be built with C# programming language, in the MAUI .NET platform. Using this technology, the app has the ability to be cross-platform. That is, it can run on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. But I will streamline this to just Android and iOS, seeing that these devices are as portable and handy as a game controller
The drone-controlling app was designed with simplicity and user experience in mind. The app's interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with large buttons for controlling the drone's movement</p>

Work Done
The application in the development phase has the following capabilities 
Take off
Land
Steer left, right, forward, and backward
Yaw
Measure battery level at intervals 

Screenshots of the app are shown below.
